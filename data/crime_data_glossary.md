Major Crime Indicator (MCI) and Shooting Glossary
Incident: An incident is the set of connected events which usually constitute an
occurrence report.
Occurrence: A written document that reflects an occurrence, unusual problem,
incident, deviation from standard practice, or situation that requires follow-up
action.
Offence: A violation against the Criminal Code of Canada or other federal
statute, provincial act, or municipal by-law. Offences are counted in the year they
are reported to police rather than the year the offence occurred. Please note that
this map shows the number of offences and some occurrences may have
multiple offences.
Violent Crime: Involve the use or threatened use of violence against a person,
including homicide, attempted murder, nonsexual assault, sexual assault,
abduction and robbery. Robbery is considered a violent crime because, unlike
other theft offences, it involves the use or threat of violence. These are counted
by the number of victims.
Property Crime: Includes unlawful acts committed for the purpose of attaining
or interfering with the use of property, but does not involve the use or threat of
violence against an individual. Property crime includes actual and attempted
motor vehicle theft, other theft, actual and attempted break and enters,
possession of stolen property, mischief and fraud etc. These are counted by the
number of occurrences.
Assault: The direct or indirect application of force to another person, or the
attempt or threat to apply force to another person, without that person’s consent.
Auto Theft: The act of taking another person's vehicle (not including attempts).
Auto Theft figures represent the number of vehicles stolen.
Break and Enter: The act of entering a place with the intent to commit an
indictable offence therein.
Homicide/Murder
Occurrence: The homicide category includes the offences of First Degree
Murder, Second Degree Murder, and Manslaughter. A homicide occurs
when a person directly or indirectly, by any means, causes the death of
another human being. Deaths caused by criminal negligence, suicide, or
accidental or justifiable homicide (i.e self-defence) are not included.
Homicide data is compiled based on the Homicide Squad Case List Log.
Count is based on offence (i.e each deceased victim)
Victim: Any deceased person where the offence of First or Second
Degree Murder or Manslaughter was committed.
Type: Homicides are categorized into three types:
• Stabbing: Where the cause of death was as a result of an
edged weapon (such as a knife or other blade).
• Shooting: Where the cause of death was as a result of
being shot with a firearm.
• Other: Where the cause of death was as a result of other
methods such as blunt force trauma or strangulation.
Robbery: The act of taking property from another person or business by the use
of force or intimidation in the presence of the victim.
Sexual Violation: A wide range of offences fall under the Sexual Assault
category, including sexual assault (s. 271), sexual assault with a weapon, threats
to a third party or causing bodily harm (s. 272), aggravated sexual assault (s.
273), administering drugs for sex (s. 212), indecent assault (s. 141, 149, 148,
156) sexual interference (s. 151), invitation to sexual touching (s. 152), and
sexual exploitation (s. 153). It refers to any type of sexual activity that is not
consented to. Behaviours may range in severity from gestures, verbal assaults
and attempts, to forced penetration, disfigurement and endangerment of life.
More so than with any other type of crime, sexual assaults (including child abuse)
are often reported to police long after the incident has taken place, if they are
reported at all.
Shooting/Firearm Discharge
Shooting Event/Occurrence: Any incident in which a projectile is
discharged from a firearm (as defined under the Criminal Code of Canada)
and injures a person. This excludes events such as suicide and police
involved firearm discharges.
Firearm Discharge: Any incident where evidence exists that a projectile
was discharged from a firearm (as defined under the Criminal Code of
Canada) including accidental discharge (non-police), celebratory fire,
drive-by etc.
Persons Injured (previously classified as “victims”): A person who
was struck by a bullet(s) as a result of the discharge of a firearm (as
defined under the Criminal Code of Canada). This excludes events such
as suicide, police-involved event or where the weapon used was not a real
firearm (such as pellet gun, air pistol, “sim-munition” etc.)
Injury Levels
Death: Where the injured person (as defined above) has died as a
result of injuries sustained from a bullet(s).
Injuries: Where the injured person (as defined above) has nonfatal physical injuries as a result of a bullet(s).
Theft Over: The act of stealing property in excess of $5,000 (excluding auto
theft).
